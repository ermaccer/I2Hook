# I2Hook
A plugin for Injustice 2


# Installation
I2Hook requires Ultimate ASI Loader(https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases). Download **Ultimate-ASI-Loader_x64.zip**
, extract dinput8.dll from the archive to I2Directory\Binaries\Retail. Extract I2Hook.asi and .ini to the same directory.

**I2Hook only supports latest Steam version!**

*Release section files already have UAL, use them if you have no idea what to do here, just drag'n'drop .zip contents toI2Directory\Binaries\Retail.*


## Features

### Character Modifier
 - You can play as anyone in any game mode, this includes NPCs such as Nightwing or boss version 
   of Brainiac.
 
### Camera Control
 - Free Camera
 - Manual Camera Position
 - Pre-set Camera modes: 1ST and 3RD person cameras

### 60 FPS Patch
 - Injustice 2 has a 30 fps cap for frontend menus, super moves and intros, with this plugin it can be unlocked to 60
 - **If your PC does not meet requirement specs, turning this option on might have negative impact on perfomance!**

## NOTE

Since some people might use this plugin for 60 fps patch only, I've added an option in the .ini which activates FPS patch only and ignores all other features. Set **b60FPSModeOnly** in ini to true to enable.
